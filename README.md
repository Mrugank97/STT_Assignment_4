# Software Tools and Techniques Lab Assignments

This repository contains the implementation of Lab Assignment 11 and Lab Assignment 12 for the CS202 Software Tools and Techniques for CSE course.

## Lab Assignment 11: Analyzing C# Console Games for Bugs

### Objective
This lab introduces students to analyses of C# Console games using Visual Studio. The focus is on understanding the control flow using the Visual Studio Debugger and identifying bugs that cause the game to crash.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
- Analyze C# console game applications
- Understand the benefit of the Visual Studio Debugger
- Understand why/how/when bugs occur in games leading to crashes

### Implementation Details
For this assignment, I selected two console games from the [dotnet-console-games](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-console-games) repository:

1. **Sliding Puzzle**: A puzzle game where you rearrange tiles to get them in order
2. **Snake**: A classic game where you control a snake to eat food and grow without hitting walls or yourself

### Debugging Process
I used Visual Studio's debugging tools to analyze the execution flow of these games by:
1. Inserting breakpoints at key locations in the code
2. Using step-in, step-over, and step-out operations to trace execution
3. Identifying and fixing bugs in the games

## Lab Assignment 12: Event-driven Programming for Windows Forms Apps in C#

### Objective
This lab introduces students to event-driven programming in C# Windows Forms Apps using Visual Studio. The focus is on understanding the event-driven paradigm and how control flows in response to events generated by user interaction or application state.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
- Develop and analyze Windows Forms Apps using C# as the development language
- Understand the benefit of the Visual Studio Toolbox
- Understand why/how/when control flow through the application due to user interaction or triggered by a certain state of the application during runtime

### Implementation Details
This assignment consists of two parts:

#### Part 1: Console Alarm Application
- Created a C# console application that accepts time input in HH:MM:SS format
- Implemented a publisher/subscriber model with a custom `raiseAlarm` event
- The application continuously checks the current system time against the user-provided time
- When the times match, the `raiseAlarm` event is triggered, calling the `Ring_alarm()` function

#### Part 2: Windows Forms Alarm Application
- Modified the console application to use Windows Forms for all input/output
- Implemented a form with a textbox for time input and a start button
- Added functionality to change the form's background color every second
- When the target time is reached, the color changes stop and a message box is displayed

### Event-Driven Programming Concepts
The implementation demonstrates key event-driven programming concepts:
1. Event declaration and subscription
2. Event triggering based on conditions
3. Event handlers for user interactions (button clicks)
4. Timer-based events for periodic actions

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition)
- .NET Framework 4.7.2
- C# Programming Language
- Windows Forms
- Visual Studio Debugger
